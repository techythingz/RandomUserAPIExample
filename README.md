# Random Uesr api example

This example uses the  [random user API](http://www.randomuser.me/documentation). 
With this application you can: 
- Retrieve users into a RandomUsers object. This contains an array list of the RandomUser object. The arraylist is called results. 
- Iterate through and display details of random users. 
- Save random users to the database (choosing which fields to save to the database)

This example uses the RestTemplate object to retrieve API information, and parses it into the RandomUsers class.
